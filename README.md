This repository contains all the necessary materials to create "Raul," a self-driving robot designed by the Brotherhood of Steel. This robot will participate in the WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition.
The members of the "Brotherhood of Steel" team are:
1. Mora Contreras, Luis Guillermo.
2. Perez Farkas, Alejandro.
3-Veliz Miguel Antonio

Modules comprising the code:

1-Red Servo Motor: Responsible for traction and power to the rear wheels to make the car move forward.
2-Gray Servo Motor: Responsible for turning an axle that moves gears.
3-Camera: When it sees a green object, it turns right, and when it detects a red object, it turns left.
1-Module that controls the ultrasonic sensors that send sound signals to see if they have an object nearby.

Introduction

Human beings have the need to improve more and more, and robotics is part of this improvement process, a fundamental area in processes necessary for the advancement of the future of society that directly affects different disciplines such as medicine, industry, agriculture, the home, among others. In this context, the project to create the robot "Raul" aside from arising from the purpose of competing in the WRO Future Engineers competition also arose from our desire to innovate and face new challenges. Furthermore, as second-semester students at the Universidad Cat√≥lica Andres Bello, we saw this as a way to develop our programming skills and also implement and learn new robotics skills. This initiative has been supported by the university since its inception, which motivates us to continue taking full advantage of the resources that the university offers us.
